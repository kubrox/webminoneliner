## What is Webmin?

http://www.webmin.com/

Webmin is a web-based interface for system administration for Unix. Using any modern web browser, you can setup user accounts, Apache, DNS, file sharing and much more. Webmin removes the need to manually edit Unix configuration files like /etc/passwd, and lets you manage a system from the console or remotely.

## Usage

* SSH into server
* Run the command
* Logon to Webmin

## Why did you create this?

It has lived in a text file for years so thought I'd put it up on here. As you can see, it's very complex

## Will this change my life?

Yes.

## Will it break anything?

Dunno.
